# FreshCart - E-Grocery Ordering App

FreshCart is an e-grocery ordering application that allows users to  order groceries for click-and-collect or delivery. The app caters to two types of users: Normal Shoppers and Shop Owners. Normal Shoppers can place orders, manage orders, rate stores, and update their personal information. Shop Owners can manage their orders, update their shop information, and perform other shop-related tasks.

Please note that the application is currently under development, and certain features such as payment gateway integration and additional UI enhancements are still in progress.
The Backend is on another repository for which you can contact freshcart.dublin@gmail.com to gain access.
